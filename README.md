# JBHairStudi0
This is a page from a hairdressing salon that I'm creating to challenge myself and add content that I'm learning. The objective is to make this project a website.
It is constantly changing, because the idea is to always improve.
For now I'm just using HTML and CSS, later on, I'll insert JAVASCRIPT.
